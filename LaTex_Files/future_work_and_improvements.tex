\section{Future Work and Improvements}

While the current implementation of the two-wheeled self-balancing robot achieved significant milestones, several areas for future improvement were identified.

\subsection{Enhanced Control Algorithms}
Exploring advanced control techniques such as adaptive control and machine learning-based approaches could further enhance the robot's stability and performance.

\subsection{Autonomous Navigation}
Integrating additional sensors like LiDAR and implementing SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms would enable the robot to navigate autonomously in complex environments.

\subsection{Mobile App Development}
Developing a dedicated mobile application with enhanced features and a more user-friendly interface would improve the overall user experience.

\subsection{Extended Battery Life}
Investigating alternative power sources or more efficient battery management systems could extend the robot's operational time.
