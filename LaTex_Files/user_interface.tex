\section{User Interface}

The user interface was designed to provide intuitive control and comprehensive feedback to the operator. Both hardware and software interfaces were developed to enhance the user experience.

\subsection{Graphical User Interface (GUI)}
A GUI was created for both desktop and mobile platforms, leveraging Bluetooth connectivity for communication. The interface included:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Real-Time Monitoring:} Display of sensor data such as tilt angle, speed, and battery status.
\item \textbf{Control Inputs:} Virtual joystick and buttons for maneuvering the robot.
\item \textbf{Parameter Adjustment:} Sliders and input fields for tuning control parameters.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physical Interface}
For manual control, physical buttons and switches were integrated on the robot's chassis. These controls allowed for quick access to basic functions like power on/off and mode switching.
