\section{Safety Features}

Ensuring the safety of both the robot and its environment was a priority in the design process. Multiple safety features were integrated into the system.

\subsection{Emergency Stop Mechanism}
An emergency stop function was implemented, allowing the robot to be immediately powered down via a physical button or remote command in case of malfunction or hazardous situations.

\subsection{Overcurrent and Overvoltage Protection}
Electronic protection circuits were included to safeguard the motors and microcontroller from electrical faults. These circuits automatically disconnected power in the event of overcurrent or overvoltage conditions.

\subsection{Fall Detection and Recovery}
Sensors were programmed to detect when the robot tipped beyond a recoverable angle. In such cases, the motors were disabled to prevent damage, and a recovery sequence could be initiated to return the robot to an upright position.
